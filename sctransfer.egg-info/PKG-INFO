Description: # The supporting Python package of SAVER-X
        
        This package is designed to be used by the R code of [SAVER-X](https://github.com/jingshuw/SAVERX).
        It contains simplified code from the python [dca](http://github.com/theislab/dca) package and the new Python code for transfer learning.
        
        One can also use this Python package for pre-training using public data. Instructions on pre-training will come out soon.
        
        ## Installation:
        
        ```
        pip install sctransfer
        ```
        The package only supports Python (>=3.5). 
        
        Update: the package now works with tensorflow 2.
