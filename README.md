It contains simplified code from the python [dca](http://github.com/theislab/dca) package and the new Python code for transfer learning.

## Installation:

```
pip install sctransfer
```
The package only supports Python (>=3.5)

Please refer to the R package [SAVERX](https://github.com/jingshuw/SAVERX) for more details.
